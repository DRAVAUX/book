# About this project

Finding hard data on tax revenues and the problems caused by the offshore economy has always been difficult. Ten years ago, even the data set on the tax take of countries around the world was so poor it was unusable.

In that time we have made some progress, and the Tax Justice Network has been able to play a leading role. In 2012 we published the Price of Offshore, authored by Jim Henry, a former chief economist at McKinsey. That estimated that there were $11.5 trillion in assets held offshore. An update to that study in 2014 revised that figure to $21-35 trillion.[^1}

@AlexCobham has been publishing work on the impact of profit shifting by multinationals on economies around the world, and in 2017 published the first impact study on the effect of profit shifting by US multinationals on individual countries.

Moving forward one of our goals is to expand the knowledge base on the impact of tax havens. We also want to make our research and data open, contributing to the global commons and allowing researchers and journalists access to a comprehensive set of research papers for their work.

To that end, we are launching a project to create a new, collaborative, online book that seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of the offshore economy.

In line with our commitment to open data, we want you, and anyone else with an interest to be able to contribute to it.

To achieve this, we are going to be authoring our book on github, the open source repository and version control system for software developers.

Although built to author software code, the platform is flexible enough to write a book on it. It also allows anyone to set up an account, comment on parts of the text, debate changes, contribute corrections or even entire new chapters.

The journey we about to embark on is a bit of an unknown. Using collaborative tools to author a book has been done before. For example, one group of maths professors, but nothing like it has been attempted in the tax justice space.

There follows a brief guide to how to use github to contribute to this project. If you want to talk to us directly, you can email book@taxjustice.net

One important thing to flag up, is that the intention is that this book will be published, and therefore please do read the authorship and accreditation section below.

# Using Github 

There are several ways you can use github to participate in the project.

If you want to make a general comment, or would like to discuss an idea you have to contribute to the project, the first and easiest thing to do is to open up an issue. To do this click on the issue tab and then click “new issue”. A text editor will open up where you can leave a message, which will then be responded to.

## Editing

Gitgub handles editing in a particular way. It is a little bit of a learning curve, but it provides an excellent way of handling edits from a variety of sources.

To edit a document you need to create your own working copy of the document. This is called a branch.

To do this you click on button which says branch in the code tab. Then enter a branch name into the text box that will appear.

Once you start working on the branch and you are ready to save your changes, hit commit. Each commit has a box which allows you to explain the changes you are making.

When you are ready to submit your changes, you submit a pull request. The pull request asks the editors to pull in your changes to the master copy. Pull requests can be commented on so that you can continue working on the branch at the suggestion of editors before the request is approved.

## Writing in github

Github uses a special type of formatting called Markdown. It is wonderfully easy to use, and once you get the hang of it you will see that it will speed up your writing. You may even choose to start using it in your other work. Markdown is a way of marking text with extremely simple codes to signify headings, footnotes, bold text and so on.

A cheatsheet for markdown formatting is available here: [https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

Github was designed for compute code and so the defult editor is a code editor. This isn’t always great for writing long texts.

For that reason, you may want to try out prose.io – prose.io works in your browser and sits on top of your github account to create a more pleasant writing environment.

# Authorship

Once completed, we intend to publish this book as a physical, paper book. The book will \(we hope\) generate royalties which will be retained by the Tax Justice Network to continue their work. By contributing to this work you should be comfortable with this idea. No individual will gain from any potential profits from this book.

We will list every contributor. Minor contributors will be thanked with an acknowledgement, major contributors will be asked to be co-authors of chapters.

Decisions on co-authoriship will be taken by the editors @alexcobham and @petarjansky
